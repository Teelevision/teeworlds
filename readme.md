# Usage

### Downloading the source
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jxsl13/zcatch.git zcatch
```

### Building the server
Enter the directory that has been created
```bash
$ cd zcatch
```

Build the release executable
```bash
$ make
or
$ make release_server
```
Build the debugging executable
```bash
$ make debug_server
```

### Starting the server
As there is an example `autoexec.cfg` file in the directory, where the built executable is placed into, we can simply start the server with any of these commands:

##### Easy way
```bash
$ ./zcatch_srv
$ ./zcatch_srv_x86_64
$ ./zcatch_srv_d
$ ./zcatch_srv_x86_64_d
```
The name behind `./` must exactly match the server executable that we built just now.
If you don't know how to see, what kind of file was built, use the unix command `ls`in order to see the current directory's content.

##### Default way
```bash
$ ./zcatch_srv -f autoexec.cfg
or any of the other variants
$ ./zcatch_srv[_x86_64|_srv_d|_x86_64_d] -f autoexec.cfg
```
If your server configuration file has a different name or a different path, you either use the relative path to the executable with `../../srv_1.cfg` or an absolute path like `/home/teeworlds/servers/zcatch/config.cfg`
